                I've been a maker on the web since the dot-com bubble. Now I'm fiddling around with the narrative of the

                Over the years, I've designed and developed so many apps that I don't even remember them all. Some were
                to solve problems, and some were for fun as well. But most of them were failures, while a few were
                blockbusters.
