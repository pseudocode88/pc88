                I've been a maker on the web since the dot-com bubble. Now I'm fiddling around with the narrative of the

                Over the years, I've designed and developed so many apps that I don't even remember them all. Some were
                to solve problems, and some were for fun as well. But most of them were failures, while a few were
                blockbusters.

                Now I'm a design leader holding the vision forte of design system in a billion-dollar evaluated company.

                Beyond work, I'm an avid collector, embracing diverse mediums like philately, music <i>(vinyl, CDs,
                    cassettes)</i>, and now, digital art.
