Okay, let's get real. When I ask designers about their personal branding plans, it's usually a mix of "I'm working on my case studies" and "I'm building a Framer website." While those are great starts, let's be honest: a website full of case studies is like a buffet with just salad. It's healthy, but it's kinda boring.

So, how do you make your design brand stand out from the crowd? Think of it like leveling up in a video game. You can't just keep doing the same thing and expect to reach the top. You've gotta diversify your skills and strategies.

## Introducing the Personal Design Branding Pyramid!

Imagine a pyramid. The bottom level is where most designers start: just showing off their work. It's like being a level 1 noob. But to climb higher, you need to do more than just showcase your skills.


### Level 2: The Storyteller

This is where things start to get interesting. It's like becoming a seasoned pro. Instead of just showing off your work, you start sharing your thoughts, insights, and experiences. Think of it as writing a design diary. It's like telling your friends about that epic dungeon you just cleared.

> Sharing your design insights, experiences, and perspectives.

**Key Activities:**

- Write blog posts about your design process, challenges, and successes.
- Contribute to design publications with articles, tutorials, or guest posts.
- Participate in online forums and communities to share your knowledge and connect with other designers.

### Level 3: The Speaker

Now you're a full-fledged boss! You're not just writing about design, you're talking about it. Think of it as giving a motivational speech before a big battle. It's a great way to get your name out there and show off your expertise.

> Leveraging your expertise to educate and inspire others.

**Key Activities:**

- Speak at conferences, meetups, and workshops on topics related to design.
- Host your own workshops or webinars to share your knowledge and skills.
- Participate in online communities as a mentor or advisor to help others grow their design careers.

### Level 4: The Educator

This is the ultimate goal. You're not just a speaker, you're a teacher. You're sharing your wisdom with the next generation of designers. Think of it as training the next batch of heroes.

> Shaping the future of design through research, experimentation, and mentorship.

**Key Activities:**

- Publish books, guides, or online courses on design topics.
- Conduct original research or experiments to advance the field of design.
- Mentor or teach aspiring designers to help them develop their skills and achieve their goals.

## Remember

This is just a guide, not a strict rulebook. You can experiment, try new things, and find your own unique path to the top of the pyramid. The most important thing is to be yourself, have fun, and keep leveling up your design brand!
